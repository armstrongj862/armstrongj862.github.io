### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was a small 
    glimpse into game designing. It’s a very simple guessing number game 
    but it shows how something as simple as guessing a number already 
    takes a bit of code and thought. It’s a neat insight into putting 
    into perspective the steps of coding a game and what a simple 
    game would look like.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was also a great lab. It was a lab whose end goal 
    was to make a animation using multiple images. The end creation looks
    beautiful and it was using the old functions to build upon new code 
    to make an animation using images and colors.
 
* Lab 8

    I also enjoyed Lab 8, part 1. The lab was reading a file and checking 
    if the words in there were palindromes. This was my first dive into learning
    about how to open and read files and used one of my favorite words, palindromes.
